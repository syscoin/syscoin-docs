# This script was created to convert a directory full
# of markdown files into rst equivalents. It uses
# pandoc to do the conversion.
#
# 1. Install pandoc from http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/
# 2. Copy this script into the directory containing the .md files
# 3. Ensure that the script has execute permissions
# 4. Run the script
#
# By default this will keep the original .md file

    echo "Converting $f to $filename.rst"
    `pandoc $f -t rst -o $filename.rst`
